Work Day Scheduler README

This project allows a user to use a simple calendar application allowing events to be saved for each hour of the day.

Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.



Here is a link to the live application: https://toddkelly.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/
